Write R programs for the following experiments:
1. A coffee vendor nearby Guwahati railway station has been having average sales of 𝑥 cups
per day. Because of the development of a bus stand nearby, it expects to increase its sales.
During the first 𝑛 days, after the inauguration of the bus stand, the daily sales were
𝑎 , 𝑎 , ⋯ , 𝑎 . On the basis of this sample information, can we conclude that the sales of coffee
have increased? WAP to perform t-test to test the hypothesis considering 𝛼 as the level of
confidence.
User Inputs: 𝑥, 𝑛, (𝑎 , 𝑎 , ⋯ , 𝑎 ), 𝛼 and anything that you feel necessary.
2. A medicine production company packages medicine in a tube of 8 ml. In maintaining the
control of the amount of medicine in tubes, they use a machine. To monitor this control a
sample of 𝑛 tubes is taken from the production line at random time interval and their contents
are measured precisely. The mean amount of medicine in these 𝑛 tubes will be used to test the
hypothesis that the machine is indeed working properly. WAP to perform the following tasks:
i) create a population of 500 counts in normal distribution with 𝜇 = 8 and 𝜎 = 0.7.
ii) pick a random sample of size 𝑛(< 500).
iii) perform Z-test to test the hypothesis considering 𝛼 as the level of confidence.
User Inputs: 𝑛, 𝛼 and anything that you feel necessary.
[Note: 𝛼 ∈ {0.01, 0.05, 0.1}. Include sufficient comments wherever necessary within the
program to make it look self-explanatory.]
