Write R programs (wherever applicable) for the following experiments:,/br.,,
1. Create a synthetic dataset of 1000 data points for Linear regression analysis and save it in a .csv file. The dataset should have only one dependent variable and one independent variable.
2. Plot the data points.
3. Normalize the above synthetic dataset and perform linear regression. For this, split the dataset into train and test sets in the ratio 60:40. Evaluate the performance of the model on the test dataset and display the result. For evaluation, use different measures such as MAE, and RMSE.
4. Plot the best fit for the regression along with the train datapoint and the test datapoint separately.
