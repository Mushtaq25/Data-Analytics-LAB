Write R programs (wherever applicable) for the following experiments: 
1. Create a synthetic dataset of 1000 data points for nonlinear regression analysis and save it in a .csv file. The dataset should have only one dependent 
variable and one independent variable.
2. Plot the data points.
3. Normalize the above synthetic dataset and perform nonlinear regression using Support Vector Regression. For this, split the dataset into train and test 
sets in the ratio 60:40. Evaluate the performance of the model on the test dataset and display the result. For evaluation, use different measures such as 
RMSE, MSE, etc.
4. Plot the best fit for the regression along with the train datapoint and the test datapoint separately.
