Lab Assignment-5

Write R programs for the following experiments:</br>
1. With the X-axis representing the normal variable x and the Y-axis representing the probability function f(x),</br>
i. write a function named normal_Distribution(<parameters>) that takes the mean and variance as input parameters and plots the normal distribution for the given mean and variance.</br>
ii. write another function named standard_Normal_Distribution(<parameters>) that takes the mean and variance as input parameters and plots the standard normal distribution for the same mean and variance above.</br>
Compare the two distribution graphs.</br>
2. Generate two random samples of 100 real numbers each from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0.2 and a standard deviation of 0.15. </br>From the two samples, create a synthetic dataset considering the samples as two features of the dataset and plot the sample points.
